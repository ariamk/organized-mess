Just a lot of random stuff, really. 

So one Friday night in November, my roommate Gaby intruduced me to HTML and CSS. One thing led to another and soon enough, with her help, I made a really cool website. It's really magical- I'll link it up here when I actually figure out how this thing works. 

Peace.
